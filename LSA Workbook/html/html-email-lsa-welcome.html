    <p class="para">Welcome to the ALS Team and welcome to your Record of Support Workbook.</p>
    <p class="para">
      A 'Record of Support' is a form that we all must complete for <i>every</i> learner that we support in <i>every</i> lesson. Your Record of Support Workbook makes this quick and easy for you to do.
    </p>
    <p>Records of Support are important because we use them to justify the funding that we receive for our learners.<br />
    <p class="para">Here's your link to access your workbook:<br /><a target="_blank", href="<?= lsaWorkbookLink ?>"><?= lsaWorkbookLink ?></p>
    <p class="para">The first time you use it, you will have to set it up with information about the learners that you support, but don't worry, there's lots of help videos, not to mention you have a very supportive team around you :)</p>
    <p class="para">Please do invest a bit of time in watching the help videos available, they are the quickest way to get up and running. They are also the best way to make sure that you get the most out of this system.</p>
    <p class="para">So here's what to do next:<br />
